Button Functionality:
1.	Numeric Buttons (1-9): Enter digits for your calculations.
2.	+, -, ร, รท: Perform basic arithmetic operations.
3.	n!: Compute the factorial of a number.
4.	Decimal(.): Include decimal points.
5.	= (Equal): Display the result of your calculation.
6.	Clear, Back: Clear the input or delete the last digit.
7.	ON, OFF: Power the calculator on or off.
8.	Modulus (%): Calculate the remainder after division.
9.	Sin, Cos, Tan: Compute trigonometric functions for angles in degrees.
10.	1/x: Quickly find the reciprocal of a number.
11.	x^2: Square the entered value.
12.	^ (to the power): Raise a number to a specified power.

Exception Handling:
This calculator is equipped with robust exception handling to enhance the user experience and ensure error-free calculations. It addresses two critical scenarios:
1.	Division by Zero: The calculator intelligently detects attempts to divide by zero, providing a clear and user-friendly error message and preventing calculations that could result in undefined values.

2.	Input Validation: To maintain data integrity, the calculator gracefully handles invalid input. Whether it's a non-numeric entry or an operation performed without appropriate operands, the system guides the user with informative messages, fostering a seamless and error-tolerant environment.
